Change colors of tech stack objects using Palette or some random genarator
More unit tests and instrumented tests
Animations
More sortable fields

App Overview:
The app retrieves JSON data representative of a CV and displays it as a list of projects demonstrating
the candidate's experience and exposure to technology. The tech stack uses custom view based on FlexBox
and material buttons. The data is cached in local database using Room and is used as a fallback in case of any API error
The data is fake for now but can be seamlessly upgraded to real data.
